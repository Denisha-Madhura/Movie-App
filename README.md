## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **Frontend** | `React` | Building the user interface and component logic. | 
| **API/Data** | `TMDB API` | Main source for movie data (posters, titles, details). | 
| **Backend/DB** | `Appwrite` | Used for tracking, aggregating, and serving the real-time "Trending Searches" data. | 
| **Utilities** | `Debounce` | Optimizing the search input to manage API calls efficiently. |


## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your local environment set up and running.

### Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

**1. Clone the repository**

```
    git clone [https://github.com/denisha-madhura/movie-app.git](https://github.com/denisha-madhura/movie-app.git)
    cd movie-app
```



**2. Install dependencies**
```
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
```



**3. Setup Environment Variables**

This project requires environment variables for both TMDB and Appwrite. Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project and add the following:

```
    # --- TMDB Configuration ---
    REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY
    
    # --- Appwrite Configuration ---
    REACT_APP_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT
    REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID
    REACT_APP_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=YOUR_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID
    REACT_APP_TRENDS_COLLECTION_ID=YOUR_TRENDS_COLLECTION_ID
```


How to get your keys:

- TMDB API Key: Register for a free account on The Movie Database (TMDB) and generate an API key.
- Appwrite Credentials:
  1. Set up an Appwrite instance (local or hosted).
  2. Create a new Project.
  3. Create a Database (e.g., movie_db).
  4. Create a Collection (e.g., search_trends) within that database. This collection is where search queries are logged.

**4. Run the application**
Start the development server:
```
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The application will now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## ðŸ›  Appwrite Implementation Details

The real-time Trending Searches feature works as follows:
- Search Log: Every time a user executes a search (after the debounce period), the search term is logged as a new document in the dedicated Appwrite collection (search_trends).
- Aggregation: The application queries Appwrite to fetch the latest search logs.
- Real-time Update: Using Appwrite's real-time capabilities or periodic polling, the front end updates the "Trending Searches" list to reflect the most frequent recent queries, offering a truly dynamic trending list.
